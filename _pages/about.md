I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. Abhinav Shrivastava. My research in computer vision centers on scene understanding, aiming to improve how embodied agents interact with their environments. My focus is on creating algorithms that allow robots to accurately see and interpret the properties, functionalities, and interrelationships of objects within their surroundings.

Prior to my PhD, I was a software engineer at Microsoft. During my undergrad, I had the oportunity to work with Dr. Ryan Farrel and Dr. David Wingate at Brigham Young University. I also worked with Dr. Abhinav Gupta at Carnegie Mellon University.
