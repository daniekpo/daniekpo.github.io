Welcome! I am an undergraduate research assistant at Brigham Young University with a keen interest in computer vision. I'm especially interested in scene understanding and visual perception. I want to spend the rest of my career doing research towards helping autonomous agents make intelligent decisions using the visual data around them.

I'm currently researching under [Ryan Farrell](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~farrell/). I just finished a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University, doing research in unsuperised video object segmentation.

When I'm not doing technical stuff, I enjoy playing soccer, running, and biking.
