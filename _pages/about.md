I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. Abhinav Shrivastava. My research is at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. I am interested in developing algorithms that enable robots and autonomous agents to accurately perceive and interpret the properties, functionalities, and interrelationships of objects in their environments. I am particularly interested in embedding semantic information, spatial understanding, and affordance knowledge into 3D representations to create efficient and robust scene representations.

Prior to my PhD, I was a software engineer at Microsoft. During my undergrad, I had the oportunity to work with Dr. Ryan Farrel and Dr. David Wingate at Brigham Young University. I also worked with Dr. Abhinav Gupta at Carnegie Mellon University.
